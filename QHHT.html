    <h3 class="title">Session Information</h3>
    <p class="pt-4">
      Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique is a fascinating therapy in which the mind, body and 
soul have endless experiences. There are different reasons why people are wanting asession. 
Pain and discomfort in the body is one of the many reasons. Some people are just curious 
about it, others are seeking more information about themselves and their life journey while 
others want to get in touch with their Higher Self.  It is an extension experience of the soul 
in which traumas from the past can be brought to the surface for more understanding and healing
    </p>
    <p class="pt-4">
      Your Subconscious or Higher Self regulates the whole body. It is the most sophisticate, 
amazing program that governs the body and keeping it alive. This wonderful power is connected 
to the Universal Consciousness, so it knows the soul and everything that the soul ever 
experienced. There is an important connection between physical health and spiritual well-being. Thephysical state of our body is often a reflection of our inner spiritual and emotional health. The health issues should not be ignored as they can reflect an imbalance within our spiritual and emotional realms. A session last between 5-7 hours, sometimes even longer, so that’s why I am offering one session per day. Since the session is recorded, you will be provided with a digital recording of your session within the next 48 hours. 
    </p>
    <p class="pt-4">
      For more information about the session, you can always email me or call me. I will do my best to 
answer as quick as possible within the same day or next.  I will be very happy to hear from 
you and I will do my best to help you.

    <h3 class="title">2.Induction</h3>
    <p class="pt-4">
      The second part of the session is the induction. Before we start the induction, I will 
      advise you to use the restrooms because during the induction, your mind and body will 
      go into a deep relaxing state in which you will be very comfortable.
    </p>
   
    <p class="pt-4">
      During the session, you will lay down into a very cozy comfortable environment in which you will be able to relax and to let go of all the worries and concerns that you might have. You
      will be getting ready to experience an amazing journey in which you and your Higher Self will be completely in control. I will be by your side all the time guiding you with questions into an amazing experience which will unfold the answers and healing that you are looking if it’s appropriate.
    </p>
   
    <p class="pt-4">
      To help you to find the best answers to your questions, we will start with a guided imaginary meditation which will help you to relax and activate the right part of the brain which is
      responsible of all the dreams and memories.

    <p class="pt-4">
      Your Higher Self will show you the most appropriate life from the past, present or sometime from the future. There is important information in that life that you need to know the most at this moment in your present life. Your Higher Self will share with you only what you needed the most to understand. It is an amazing loving and caring higher power that is part of you and always wants the best for you. Understanding the information and making the connection between past life and present life will help you to understand the root of your issues, to gain more clarity and
      to perform the necessary changes in your life for your own well-being.

    <h3 class="title">4.Calling the Subconscious /Higher Self</h3>
    <p class="pt-4">
      The Subconscious is the higher aspect of you. It is the gut feeling, the intuition, and the knowing
      feeling that you experience all the time. It is the part of you that always knows and sees everything from a higher perspective. It is the powerful wise energy that governs your entire body being connected with the Universe, Source,
      God -The Infinite Energy.
    </p>
   
    <p class="pt-4">
      In the second part of the induction, I will ask for your Subconscious to come forward, to answer your questions and heal the body.
    </p>
   
    <p class="pt-4">
      Your Subconscious has the amazing power to detect physical and emotional problems. It also can provide you with information regarding the root of these issues being from a past or present life. I will ask the Subconscious for healing these problems and if is appropriate, the healing will be instantly done like a miracle. The body heals when the root of the problem is found, understood and released.
    
    </p>


    <p class="pt-4">

      Amazing healing has been done during QHHT sessions. Everything is possible. It is essential for you to want to be healed. You must understand and allow it. During the session, your Subconscious will provide you with answers that will help you to understand what was happening in the past, how to prevent it, what to change in your present life and not to repeat the same mistake in the future. It is important to be open mind and to understand what your Higher Self is trying to teach you.
      This part in you, the Higher Self is healing and counseling you so you can move forward in the best way possible.

    <p class="pt-4">
      when you return from hyptnic state ,we will talk about what was shown to you  by your Subconscious which will also provide you with wonderful advice. It is very important to listen to your recording as often as possible. While you will be listening to it, you will be transported
      back into that wonderful higher vibrational energy state from nation; therefore, healing, a deeper understanding of your life situation, and new
    messages can occur.
